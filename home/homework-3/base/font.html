You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop
And you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel all right when you hear that music ring
<hr style="color: rgb(248, 71, 26); width: 500px; height: 2px;">
You step inside but
You don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain
To hear the jazz go down
Too much competition
Too many other places
But not too many horns can
Make that sound
Way on downsouth
Way on downsouth London town
<hr style="width: 500px; height: 2px;">
You check out Guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
And an old guitar is all
He can afford
When he gets up under the lights
To play his thing
<hr style="width: 500px; height: 2px;">
And Harry doesn't mind
If he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job
He's doing alright
He can play honky tonk
Just like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing
<hr style="width: 500px; height: 2px;">
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn about
Any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
And the Sultans played Creole
<hr style="width: 500px; height: 2px;">
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just
As the time bell rings
'Thank you goodnight now
It's time to go home'
And he makes it fast with one more thing
'We are the Sultans Sultans of Swing'
